# DISEASE-PATTERN-ANALYSIS-
This project analyzes disease patterns using synthetic patient data and uses machine learning 
techniques such as K-Means clustering and Apriori association rule learning. The analysis 
aims to discover hidden patterns in the combination of medical conditions such as diabetes, 
hypertension, and others. 
Project Overview 
This project is built using the following: 
1. Data Generation: Synthetic patient data is generated using the Faker library. Each 
patient has a unique ID and a random selection of conditions from a predefined list of 
common health issues. 
2. One-Hot Encoding: The patient conditions are transformed into a one-hot encoded 
format, which allows machine learning algorithms to process the data efficiently. 
3. K-Means Clustering: K-Means is used to group patients into clusters based on the 
conditions they have, helping identify patterns among patients with similar disease 
profiles. 
4. Association Rule Learning: The Apriori algorithm is applied to find frequent co
occurring conditions, generating association rules that provide insights into which 
diseases tend to appear together. 
5. 3D Visualization: The results of the clustering are visualized in an interactive 3D plot 
using the Plotly library, helping to understand the distribution and clustering of 
disease patterns in a more intuitive manner. 
Key Features 
• K-Means Clustering: Patients are clustered into three distinct groups based on their 
medical conditions, making it easier to identify patterns among patients with similar 
health profiles. 
• Apriori Algorithm: Association rules are generated to find relationships between 
medical conditions, revealing insights into how certain conditions are linked. 
• 3D Visualization: An interactive 3D scatter plot visualizes the clusters of patients, 
allowing for better data exploration. 
• Synthetic Data: Data is generated using the Faker library, simulating real-world 
scenarios with multiple medical conditions for each patient. 
Libraries and Tools 
The following libraries are used in this project: 
• Pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame operations. 
• Scikit-learn: For clustering using the K-Means algorithm. 
• MLxtend: For applying the Apriori algorithm and generating association rules. 
• Plotly: For creating interactive 3D visualizations of the disease patterns. 
• Faker: For generating synthetic data representing patients with various conditions. 
Installation 
To run the project, first install the necessary libraries by running the following command: 
!pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn mlxtend plotly faker 
How to Run 
1. Data Generation: The script uses the Faker library to generate 1000 synthetic patient 
records, each with 1-4 random medical conditions. 
2. One-Hot Encoding: The conditions are one-hot encoded to prepare for machine 
learning models. 
3. K-Means Clustering: Run the K-Means clustering algorithm to group patients into 
clusters based on their health conditions. 
4. Association Rule Learning: Apply the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets 
and generate association rules between the medical conditions. 
5. 3D Visualization: Visualize the clusters in an interactive 3D plot using Plotly. 
Project Structure 
• disease_pattern_analysis.py: The main Python script that performs data generation, 
clustering, association rule learning, and visualization. 
• README.md: This file contains details about the project and instructions for 
running it. 
Example Output 
• K-Means Clustering: Example output showing patients clustered based on disease 
patterns. 
• Association Rules: Example rules generated by the Apriori algorithm, such as: 
o If a patient has Hypertension and Diabetes, there's a 70% chance they also 
have Obesity. 
Sample Code 
python 
# K-Means Clustering 
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42) 
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(onehot_conditions) 
# Apply Apriori Algorithm 
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df_onehot_bool, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True) 
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1) 
# 3D Visualization 
fig = px.scatter_3d(df_onehot, x=df_onehot.columns[0], y=df_onehot.columns[1], 
z=df_onehot.columns[2], color=df['Cluster']) 
fig.show() 
Future Improvements 
• Additional Conditions: The project can be extended by adding more complex 
medical conditions, including autoimmune disorders and neurological issues. 
• Real-World Data: This project uses synthetic data. Incorporating real-world datasets 
will make the insights more valuable. 
• Enhanced Visualization: Additional visualizations like heatmaps can be used to 
represent the co-occurrence of conditions more effectively. 
Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering and association rule learning to 
analyze disease patterns. By generating synthetic data, it simulates a real-world scenario 
where identifying relationships between conditions is crucial for healthcare insights.
